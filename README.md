# Make-a-Data-Story-with-Tableau
This is a group assignment that required us to make a Data Story from a selected dataset.

# Introduction
We selected CO2 emissions by sector (CAIT, 2020) data from [GitHub](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/CO2%20emissions%20by%20sector%20(CAIT%2C%202020)/CO2%20emissions%20by%20sector%20(CAIT%2C%202020).csv) as our assignment dataset. We are assign to look at the raw data file and understand the data that was collected. We using Tableau (daat visualization tool) to help us find an interesting pattern by experiment with different charttypes for visualizing that data in our dataset. The final visualization will be perform by dashboard that combines numerous interesting visualizations.

# Motivation
Using Tableau to identify intriguing trends, patterns, and relationships in data. Following the discovery, we are able to highlight a fascinating story to provide viewers with a clear comprehension of our findings. The ease of use of Tableau encourages us to explore more in order to expand our visualisation skills.

# Benefits of this study
Increase knowledge of analysis skill and make use of Tableau.
